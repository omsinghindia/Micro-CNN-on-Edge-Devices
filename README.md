# ðŸ§  Micro CNN from Scratch

A minimalistic implementation of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** from scratch in Pythonâ€”no deep learning libraries used (except for NumPy). Perfect for educational purposes and gaining an intuitive understanding of CNN internals

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This repository contains Python code that:

- Implements the full **forward and backward passes** of a CNN from scratch.
- Uses only `NumPy` for matrix operations.
- Trains on a small dataset (e.g., MNIST subset or toy dataset).
- Demonstrates core CNN components:
  - Convolutional Layer
  - ReLU Activation
  - MaxPooling
  - Fully Connected Layers
  - Softmax & Cross-Entropy Loss
